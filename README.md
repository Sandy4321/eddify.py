# eddify.py
make code less confusing by renaming all the variables to be more uniform

both `eddify.py` and `eddify_.py` work the same; `eddify_.py` has simply been processed by this script as an example of the output -- it writes the output to a file with the name of the original followed by an underscore.

only works on python for now :(
